### App Trader: Premise

Our team was hired by a fictional company called App Trader to help them explore and gain insights from apps that are made available through the Apple App Store and Android Play Store. App Trader is a broker that purchases the rights to apps from developers in order to market the apps and offer in-app purchase. App developers retain **all** money from users purchasing the app, and they retain _half_ of the money made from in-app purchases. App Trader is solely responsible for marketing apps they purchase rights to.  

Our team was instructed to make recommendations to App Trader on what apps to purchase based upon the following assumptions:

<blockquote>a. App Trader purchases apps for 10,000 times the price of the app. For apps that are priced from free up to $1.00, the purchase price is $10,000.

b. Apps earn $5000 per month on average from in-app advertising and in-app purchases _regardless_ of the price of the app.  

c. App Trader spends an average of $1000 per month to market an app _regardless_ of the price of the app. If App Trader owns rights to the app in both stores, it can market the app for both stores for a single cost of $1000 per month.  

d. For every half point that an app gains in rating, its projected lifespan increases by one year, in other words, an app with a rating of 0 can be expected to be in use for 1 year, an app with a rating of 1.0 can be expected to last 3 years, and an app with a rating of 4.0 can be expected to last 9 years. Ratings should be rounded to the nearest 0.5 to evaluate an app's likely longevity.  

e. App Trader would prefer to work with apps that are available in both the App Store and the Play Store since they can market both for the same $1000 per month.</blockquote>


Lastly, this was a group project. However, the analysis, visuals, and PowerPoint presentation in this repository were all created by me. 

#### 1. Analysis
Analysis was completed exclusively in SQL using 2 datasets: apple store data and play store data. There were a number of issues to work through, as each app store has its own ratings, price, genre and content rating. Apple's genres are much broader than the play store's, so My first step was to get data types constant across both datasets. 





#### 2.  

#### 3. Deliverables
a. Develop some general recommendations as to the price range, genre, content rating, or anything else for apps that the company should target.  

b. Develop a Top 10 List of the apps that App Trader should buy next week for its **Black Friday** debut.  

c. Prepare a 5-10 minute presentation for the leadership team of App Trader to inform them of your recommendations.



### All analysis work must be done in PostgreSQL, however you may export query results if you want to create charts in Excel for your presentations.
